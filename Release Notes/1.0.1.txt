* Release notes for version 1.0.1 (Beta Candidate)

Comments
=========================================================================================================
Version 1.0.1 is a fairly major upgrade from version 1.0 Alpha, and includes a bunch of bug fixes and
additional feature implementations.

It is highly recommended to upgrade to 1.0.1 if you're currently using version 1.0 Alpha.
In addition, it's important to note that I am no longer making any bug fixes or improvements
to any version prior to 1.0 Alpha, so if you'd like to take advantage of the additional features
and/or bug fixes, you'll want to plan on upgrading to the newest version sometime during your
maintenance/implemenation cycle.

Changes
=========================================================================================================
- Added support for Attendees.

  aggregated and worked on as a single unit, and assist in giving DDay.iCal an object-oriented feel.
- Fixed some various warnings.
- Temporarily removed examples 3 and 4 because they use implementations that have been removed from DDay.iCal.
